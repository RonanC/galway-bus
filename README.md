# Galway City Bus - API
A progressive web application for tracking Galway city buses.

## Inspiration
I use the bus every day to get to work.  
The city buses in Galway are not to be relied on (the main reason being due to lack of bus lanes).
I want a simple cross platform way to be able to quickly check when my next bus will be due.

## This Project
I simply want this project to transform the current public API (https://rtpi.ie/) into something consumable.
Be that REST or GraphQL.

I want to take advantage of the newest technologies.

## Goals
- Create a Node/Express application.
- Use the Apollo GraphQL server for the API or simple REST endpoints.
- Have a single page at root describing how to use the API.
- Host is on Heroku.

## PWA
I wish to create a Progressive Web Application that will consume this API (in another project).
- Use Angular.
- Use Local Storage for users preference data.
- Use Firebase for long term storage if needed (optional).
- Use Google Maps API

## Settings
- Favourite routes
- Show buses/stops
